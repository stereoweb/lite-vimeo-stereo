/**
 *
 * The shadowDom / Intersection Observer version of Paul's concept:
 * https://github.com/paulirish/lite-youtube-embed
 *
 * A lightweight YouTube embed. Still should feel the same to the user, just
 * MUCH faster to initialize and paint.
 *
 * Thx to these as the inspiration

 *   https://autoplay-youtube-player.glitch.me/

 * Once built it, I also found these (üëçüëç):
